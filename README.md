## Overview :

This analysis aims to determine if opening a Surf and Shake shop in Oahu, Hawaii would be a viable business throughout the year. The main factor that could impact the success of the shop is the weather conditions in Oahu. Rainy days could significantly decrease the number of customers wanting to surf or purchase ice cream. The data used in this analysis consists of approximately seven years of temperature and precipitation recordings from nine stations in and around Oahu.

## Results:

The results of the analysis show that the average temperature in Oahu is suitable for surfing throughout the year, but there are more days with temperatures below 70 degrees in December compared to June. Additionally, the temperature range in December is more extreme, with a 27 degree difference between the minimum and maximum temperatures, while the range in June is 21 degrees. These findings suggest that June may be the more favorable month for surfing in Oahu due to more consistent weather conditions. However, the number of rainy days is also an important factor to consider when determining the profitability of a surf and shake shop in Oahu.

## Summary:

In summary, the analysis suggests that weather is an important factor to consider when deciding if a Surf and Shake shop will be profitable in Oahu. Rainy days are especially important to consider, as they can greatly impact the number of customers. It appears that the UPPER WAHIAWA 874.3 station is the best location for the shop, as it has had few rainy days in both June and December. On the other hand, the MANOA LYON ARBO 785.2 station is not a good location due to the high number of rainy days in both months. The average temperature in Oahu is suitable for surfing throughout the year, but June is slightly more favorable due to fewer days with temperatures below 70 degrees.
